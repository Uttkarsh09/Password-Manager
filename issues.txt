1) Scenario 
    User Decrypts the passwords
    Makes changes to the passwords
    Chooses to decrypt again -> by this the new changed passwords can be resetted

    Possible solution
        Add a variable to check whether the passwords are decrypted or not
        and ignore/prevent the user from doing it again.

2) Remove the ? before the password file by customizing the custom_input_2 in userInput.py
and removing the question wala some property from the object

3) You have to remove pycrypto and pycryptodome and then install pycryptodome again
for the code to work. -> make an installation script which is ran once in the beginning
